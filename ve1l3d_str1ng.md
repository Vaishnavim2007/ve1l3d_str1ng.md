METHODS: <br/>
•	First we connect the microcontroller to the system. Then we open PuTTY and configure the connection settings <br/>
       Connection type: Serial <br/>
       Port speed: 115200 <br/>
•	Device address: /dev/ttyUSB0 (we will get it by checking the ip address) <br/>
•	And then we start filling the blanks with random characters and numbers . The ones which are correct get printed and incorrect ones don’t.<br/>
•	And then we spell them together to get the flag <br/>
WHAT I LEARNT: <br/>
•	We will learn how to configure PuTTY to establish a serial connection with a microcontroller <br/>
•	Learned  to analyze responses from the microcontroller to understand which inputs are correct or incorrect, based on the feedback we receive <br/>
•	I gained practical experience interacting with embedded systems or microcontrollers via serial communication, which is useful in various technical fields, including electronics and Iot <br/>
